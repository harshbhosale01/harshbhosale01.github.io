From my childhood, I was always nosy to know how does the infrared remotes work and what thing lies inside them. So, I along with my friend [Manan Shanghvi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manan-shanghvi-393537282/) thought of giving it a try and understanding them. 

I decided to work with AC remotes because of the fact that IR codes for AC's are composite and are not just commands, but contain all the necessary information about the operating mode of the AC  and there is usually a check sum as well. While the TV remote just sends a HEX code to its receiver. For example:
